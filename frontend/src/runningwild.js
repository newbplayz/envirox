        <h2>Running Wild: PFAS Pollution in Vietnam</h2>
        <p>There are more than nutrients in the breast milk of Vietnamese mothers but also per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), a group of artificial chemicals, a figure 3.75 times higher than the maximum level of PFAS permitted by the Vermont state of the United States. </p>
        <p>The impacts of the discovery and manufacturing of PFAS are multifaceted and complicated. Recognized for their resistance to heat, water, and oil, these chemicals have become a preferred option for numerous products. They have been widely utilized in various industries since the 1940s, bringing convenience and advancement to human society. However, there is a price to pay for the convenience. PFAS, also known as “forever chemicals” for their indestructibility, poses significant worldwide threats to the environment and human health. These toxic substances, originating from industrial practices, agricultural runoff, and consumer products, bioaccumulate in living organisms. Today, running in both the water system and the human blood, PFAS presents substantial risks to the environment and human health in Vietnam.</p>
        <h4>Far-Reaching Damage to Ecosystems and Human Health</h4>
        <p>PFAS creates a severe threat to aquatic ecosystems and wildlife. PFAS is associated with the development of lumps in animals, reduced reproductive success in birds, and damaged liver, kidney, and immune systems in laboratory animals. Given its long-term persistence, PFAS bioaccumulates inside the organisms until reaching a certain point that would cause death. The dead body, containing PFAS, then gets eaten by other organisms, and its concentration level builds up along the food web. Up to 2023, 600 animal species are at risk of PFAS. </p>
        <p>Similarly, bioaccumulation of PFAS also exists in Vietnam’s agricultural system. PFAS in the soil, air, and water moves into the crops, eventually consumed by animals and humans. Although the amount of PFAS in crops is not fatal, the amount that accumulates in the digestive system of humans is enough to be deadly, leading to potential chronic diseases such as cancer. PFAS in mothers’ breast milk can also result in severe health effects on infant birth weight, behavior, and growth rate. </p>
        <h4>Sources of Contamination are Everywhere</h4>
        <p>A wide range of sources contribute to PFAS contamination, with industrial practices being a primary contributor. Industrial sectors such as electronics and printed circuit board manufacturing heavily rely on PFAS. Limited progress in disposal technology hinders the development of effective PFAS treatment solutions, coupled with the lack of public awareness, which results in increased improper disposal of PFAS, exacerbating contamination. By 2021, the majority of Vietnam's industrial PFAS waste will head to landfills, with only 20% meeting sanitary standards, compounding environmental and health hazards. </p>
        <p>Moreover, agriculture, one of Vietnam’s most significant parts of the economy, also intensively uses PFAS-containing fertilizers and pesticides. As these substances diffuse into the soil and water, PFAS can bioaccumulate in crops, leading to further pathways for human consumption. </p>
        <p>What the public does not realize is that PFAS is present in various everyday items. Any purchase could unintentionally contribute to PFAS pollution. For instance, the Teflon coatings on non-stick cookware start to release harmful chemicals when exposed to temperatures above 260°C, potentially causing polymer fume fever to those who inhale them, with symptoms including choking sensation, joint pains, and chest tightness. Yet, despite these health risks, the non-stick cookware market is projected to grow, reaching 31.4 billion dollars by 2031. The same trend extends to a wide range of necessities, such as waterproof clothing, food packages, and personal care products like sunscreen and cosmetics.     </p>
        <h4>Treat the Cause, Not the Symptoms</h4>
        <p>The current solutions to PFAS pollution, mostly technology-based, have been effective in addressing the symptoms but not the root cause. Detection methods like liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry identify PFAS compounds by their chemical characteristics and measure PFAS molecules by examining their mass and electrical charge. Admittedly, technological advancements have brought about various remediation methods. For instance, photocatalysis uses light to break down contaminates; electrochemical treatment applies an electrical current to create chemical reactions that can decompose PFAS; and membrane filtration involves specialized filters with small pores to remove contaminants selectively. These advanced methods, including technologies like ultraviolet light and nanofiltration membranes, efficiently eliminate PFAS contaminants in soil and groundwater. </p>
        <p>Nevertheless, challenges in technological solutions, such as the complex disposal process and high costs of remediation, make it unsustainable for developing countries like Vietnam to solely rely on technologies to tackle PFAS pollution. It is also far from enough to only mitigate the damage without addressing the source of contamination. More comprehensive solutions with an emphasis on regulation and reformation of the sources of PFAS are crucial.</p>
        <h4>Solutions Rely on More Than Technological Advancement </h4>
        <p>As we look toward future solutions to PFAS contamination in Vietnam, two foundational pillars emerge: policy changes and community involvement. </p>
        <p>On the policy front, there is a need for stricter guidelines and enforcement. Several policies have been enacted to tackle the PFAS issue in Vietnam, such as “Guidance on Inventory Techniques, Safety Management, and Risk Control for Perfluorooctane Sulfonate.” However, regulations and supervision in all sectors related to the use of PFAS are essential to comprehensively address the multitude of PFAS issues in Vietnam. To fill the gaps, stringent regulatory policies regarding the use and disposal of hazardous chemicals are imperative. The maximum permissible levels of PFAS established by the World Trade Organization and practices in the United States and Europe provide potential templates for the Vietnam government to establish their own policies and laws.</p>
        <p>Proactive collaboration in technological innovations across professional organizations and countries can potentially reduce PFAS usage. Scholars have made progress in developing replacement technologies, such as substituting PFAS with less harmful substances that have similar chemical characteristics. Countries can collectively fund and share research programs to find alternatives to PFAS or innovate production technologies that require less amount of PFAS. </p>
        <p>Beyond top-down solutions, bottom-up changes also play a significant role in driving changes in the whole society. Increasing awareness about the environmental and health risks associated with PFAS through mass media is a central factor in reducing the production of PFAS-containing products. Consumers can take on the responsibilities by lowering the consumption of products with PFAS or switching to PFAS-free ones. Besides, both individuals and businesses should strictly follow the government’s disposal guidelines in regard to PFAS, including but not limited to rigorous waste classification and curated recycling. </p>
        <h4>Looking Ahead</h4>
        <p>Vietnam faces both challenges and opportunities in confrontation with PFAS. As Vietnam’s economy increasingly relies on electronic device manufacturing, the growth of PFAS usage is unlikely to stop in the future. Consequently, the pressing issue of PFAS contamination will continue to influence multiple aspects of society, making it even more urgent to find a balance between economic evolution and the health of citizens and ecosystems. Meanwhile, technological advancements are likely to reform industrial production and boost the efficiency of PFAS disposal.</p>
        <p>Implications of Vietnam’s coping with PFAS serve as a reminder for countries around the globe. Improvement in the sustainable use of PFAS in Vietnam will provide an inspiring framework for developing countries with similar struggles. The agency of choosing to move toward a cleaner or more polluted future is in Vietnam’s hands.</p>
